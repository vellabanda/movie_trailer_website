# Movie Trailer Project
This project is a part of [Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004). 
In this project a movie trailer website has been created. The website contains a few of my favorite movies names and trailers.

## Getting Started
* For running the code on this code you will need python 2.7.X to be installed. The package can be downloaded from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* A web browser and access to internet is also required as the trailers are pulled from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) and the movie posters are captured from the Internet.

## Usage
* To run this code, save all three python files([entertainment_center.py](https://github.com/vellabanda/movie_trailer_website/blob/master/entertainment_center.py), [fresh_tomatoes.py](https://github.com/vellabanda/movie_trailer_website/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py), and [media.py](https://github.com/vellabanda/movie_trailer_website/blob/master/media.py)) in one folder
  * In Windows open command prompt and navigate to the location of folder where the python files have been saved
  * In Mac or any other linux machine, open terminal and navigate to the location of folder where the python files have been saved
* Run the below command to open the movie trailer website:
``` 
python entertainment_center.py 
```

# Altering the code
* Addition of editing of movies can be done in the entertainment_center.py file
* [fresh_tomatoes.py](https://github.com/vellabanda/movie_trailer_website/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py) has been provided by Udacity. more information can be found [here](https://github.com/allanbreyes/udacity-full-stack/blob/master/p1/fresh_tomatoes.py)
